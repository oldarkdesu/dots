STYLE CODES
Code 0 resets everything to normal. Codes 1 to 9 set the font style to bold, 
faint, italic, underline, blink, fastblink, invert, conceal and strike, 
respectively.

COLOR CODES
Where X is an integer from 0 to 9: 

 3X -> Foreground of color X (dim)
 4X -> Background of color X (dim)
 9X -> Foreground of color X (bright) (non-standard but widely supported)
10X -> Background of color X (bright) (non-standard but widely supported)

0 to 7 integers correspond to: 
0: Black 2: Green   4: Blue    6: Cyan
1: Red   3: Yellow  5: Magenta 7: White

While 8 and 9 have special meaning:
8: Idexed colors and Truecolor (not used in this script)
9: Default Color

This script (when not passing `--help` or `-h` or `info` as the first arg) shows
Styles 1 through 9 (and normal text for reference) in both dim and bright ver-
sions of the foreground colors 0 to 7 (plus the default foreground color).
Support for blinking seems to be uncommon across terminals, and I have not come
across any terminal that supports fast blinking.
